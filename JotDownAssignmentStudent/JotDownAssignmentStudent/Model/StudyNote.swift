// TO DO:
//
// In this file, you will define a SwiftData model called `StudyNote`.
// The purpose of this model is to represent a study note that will be
// stored and retrieved in the app’s database.
//
// Each `StudyNote` should have the following pieces of information:
//
// 1. A unique identifier (UUID) so each note can be tracked.
// 2. A title
// 3. The full original text of the note
// 4. A summary of the note —
// 5. The date the note was created
//
// Instructions:
// Using SwiftData, implement a class for the StudyNote model.
// HINT: You might need to use the @Model and @Attribute tags to be able to store this model in SwiftData
//
// EXAMPLE of what this model will be used for in the app:
// - When a student uploads a `.txt` or `.pdf` file, the contents will be stored in
//   the `originalText` property.
// - The student (or the app) can then add a `summary` to the note.
// - The model will let us organize notes by course and keep track of when they were created.
//
// HINT: Look at the sample properties above and think about what types they should be.
// Then write the class definition yourself.
